# RSfilter

Simple resume filter which can be used to filter large number of resumes using keywords.

__Note i created this project for current working company HR team.__

## How to use 

I accidentally added windows executable to my github repository so now i can use it to filter resumes without installing it on windows machine. So download `rsfilter.exe` from my github repository and run it. For windows machine you can add it to your PATH variable. for linux or mac you clone the repository and run it from there or build it from source code.

1. Go to folder containing resumes

```bash
$ rsfilter
```

2. Enter keywords to filter

3. rsfilter will make a folder based on keywords and current timestamp and move suitable resumes to that folder.

## Btw

Always try to read all resume manually maybe you can find some useful information in it.
